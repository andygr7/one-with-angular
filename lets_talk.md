Hi Andrei,

That’s my favorite name! :)

I am reaching out because in your LinkedIn summary you mentioned that you have broad experience with different technologies and I thought you might be a good fit for our projects.

I’m the head of recruiting for [Mixbook](https://github.com/mixbook), a profitable, mature company based in San Francisco with our main development office here in Moldova. Our current team consists of 12 senior engineers and we have a strong passion for clean, testable code, code reviews, continuous integration, and newer technologies, like [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/) and [Typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript) :)

I’m not sure if you are exploring new opportunities, but either way, I think it would be great to connect with you and tell you about our company, team, and some of things we offer our team and their families. Who knows, maybe there is a way we can work together either now or in the future.

I would love to meet up for coffee to learn more about what you are interested in and tell you more about our company. Are you around to grab some coffee after work? Ping me to ```@andygr7``` or shoot an email to agritaenco@mixbook.com
